# bash log
## v0.2b
this is a small script (scripts) that generate html files to run your static blog
the current version doesn't do much, just makes a post html file from a file you give it to it and then generates "index" of all your posts

## future features
in future versions i'd like to add archive (categorised by year and month of posting), specific title for every post and some other stuff i can't remember

## what you won't see in future
right now i am not planning to support markdown, i just html tags in my posts.
