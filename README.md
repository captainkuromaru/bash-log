# bash log
## v0.3b
bash log (blog for short) is a small script (scripts) that generates html files to run your static blog
the current version doesn't do much, just makes a post html file from a file you give it to it and then generates "index" of all your posts

### notes
i added link to previous posts, the next thing will be retroactively adding "next post" links to files

## future features
in future versions i'd like to add archive (categorised by year and month of posting), specific title for every post, links to previous/next posts, an easy way to configure everything in one file, and some other stuff i can't remember rn

## what you won't see in the future
right now i am not planning to support markdown, i just use html tags in my posts.
