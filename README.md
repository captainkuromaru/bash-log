# bash log
## v0.5b
bash log (blog for short) is a small script (scripts) that generates html files to run your static blog
the current version doesn't do much, just makes a post html file from a file you give it to it and then generates "index" of all your posts

### notes
the next thing is setting title tags for the post based drafts

## future features
in future versions i'd like to add archive (categorised by year and month of posting), specific title for every post, an easy way to configure everything in one file, and some other stuff i can't remember rn

## what you won't see in the future
right now i am not planning to support markdown, i just use html tags in my posts.
